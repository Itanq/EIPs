## 摘要

An instruction is designated to remain as an invalid instruction.

## 动机

The invalid instruction can be used as a distinct reason to abort execution.

## 规范

The opcode `0xfe` is the `INVALID` instruction. It can be used to abort the execution (i.e. duplicates as an `ABORT` instruction).

## 向后兼容

This instruction was never used and therefore has no effect on past contracts.
